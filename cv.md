## About Myself
I graduated with honor from the university and got bachelor's and master's degree in Civil Engineering. After work as an engineer and serviceman I'm trying to own new skills and abilities. I want to know more about front end development, learn basics for a start and perhaps become a good specialist in this area. 

The most interesting tasks in any line of my work are data analysis and its visualization, interactivity of information, automation of calculations and searching for the best option.
## Skills
* HTML&CSS Basics;
* JavaScript (Data types, Objects, Functions and Classes);
* Version control: Git and GitHub;
* Operating systems: Windows OS, Linux (Ubuntu);

* Engineering software: SCAD, Tekla, AutoCAD, Revit, MathCAD.
## Code Example
```
function disco(from, to) {
    let i = from;

    let counter = function () {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
          document.body.style.background = "orangered"
          } else {
          document.body.style.background = "green"
        }

        if (i == to) {clearTimeout(timerId)};
        i++;
    }

    counter(); //delay is canceled with this string
    let timerId = setInterval(counter, 500);
}

disco(1, 7);
```
